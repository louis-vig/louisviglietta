    <!-- About section-->
    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a student in the Computer Science department at Princeton University.
      I have a passion for technology, and love learning and applying new skills to create
      exciting projects, whether for fun or to solve critical problems! When not in class,
      I play flute for the Princeton University Sinfonia and serve as the treasurer of First College Council.
    </p>

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I have done lab-based research in areas ranging from superconducting crystals, chemotherapeutic drug
      mechanisms, and computational metabolic engineering.

      During my most recent research experience, I helped identify candidate genetic modifications in the yeast
      <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> that could potentially increase their production rates of ethyl acetate.
      I achieved this by using genome scale models of yeast metabolism and COBRA (constraint based reconstruction and analysis)
      to simulate in MATLAB how these modified strains would behave in different growth conditions. By editing
      existing models and adding heterologous pathways, I helped to identify candidate yeast strains with increased
      production capacity and even the ability to uptake additional substrates. If confirmed <i>in vivo</i>, this could
      make bioproduction of ethyl acetate more feasible, which could eliminate or reduce the need for
      petroleum-based production.
    </p>

    <h1>Coursework</h1>
    <p>
      I have taken a variety of technical courses. Here are a few:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Data Structures and Algorithms:</b> Covers structures such as binary heaps,
          union-finds, (balanced) binary search trees, linked lists, hash tables, and more.
          Discusses algorithms such as sorting algorithms, binary search, tree traversal, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Optimization:</b> Covers optimization techniques such as least squares and
           linear optimization in the context of data fitting, portfolio optimization,
           optimal control, and more. Projects/homeworks involve solving optimization problems in Python using the
           NumPy and CVXPY libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Intro to Programming Systems:</b> Teaches important programming skills such as
          modular design and proper testing. Coursework and project assignments were completed
          in C and ARM assembly language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fundamentals of Statistics:</b> As described, covered fundamental statistical concepts such as
          hypothesis testing, linear regression, and probability. I analyzed data in R
          to complete homework assignments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reasoning about Computation:</b> Discusses theoretical aspect of computer science,
          covering topics such as probability and graph theories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Probability and Stochastic Systems:</b> Discusses discrete and continuous
          random variables, commonly-found probability distributions, and stochastic processes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
