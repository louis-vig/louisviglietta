          I developed this project in Java in December of 2021, but am still making changes.
          I decided to embark on this project after seeing it suggested in a YouTube video.
          Having already worked a bit in Swing/AWT after the <a href="#gameoflife">Game of Life</a> project, I decided to develop
          it in Java. Taking inspiration from the YouTube video, I designed and implemented the modules,
          and learned the necessary tools in the Swift API to create the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game works in one window, meaning that ideally 2 players can play by taking
          turns in the same window. However, a possible future project is to implement
          some form of chess AI to play against the player, making the game single player.

          I created this simulator in December of 2021. This project was inspired by a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo">YouTube video by Veritasium</a>
          about the incompleteness theorem. In it, he introduced Conway's Game of Life,
          a cellular automaton. Each cell can be "dead" or "alive." At each step of the
          animation, a cell's status is decided by its neighbors:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If it has more than 3 or less than 2 neighbors, it dies.
            </li>
            <li>
              If it has 2 neighbors, it remains in whatever state it began.
            </li>
            <li>
              If it has exactly 3 neighbors, it becomes alive even if it was previously dead.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was very intrigued by this idea, and felt like it was feasible to recreate it myself
          in Java. I had never worked previously with creating graphics or GUIs in Java, but decided
          it would be a fun project to learn those skills. I learned the basics of the Swift/AWT APIs
          to implement the GUI and the simulator, and coded the mechanism behind the automaton.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "player" begins by dragging/clicking to flip cells from dead to alive or vice versa.
          The player can then begin the animation. There are options to stop the animation,
          clear the board, update the board by one frame, and change the delay between frames of the animation. The player
          can still manually update cells with the mouse while the animation is running.

          This project was done as part of my Math Research class in my senior year of high school.
          I decided I wanted to research the topic of Markov chains, and found that
          an interesting application might be in language processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, Donald Trump was president, and his Tweets had a very distinct vernacular.
          I decided to create a program that analyzes his previous tweets and generates new
          tweets in his style.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first took a database of several of Trump's previous tweets. The program
          then analyzed each word individually. For each distinct word in the data,
          it determined which words followed it and with what probabilities. From these probabilites,
          a transition matrix was created. Then, beginning with a seed word, a sentence was formed
          word-by-word using the transition matrix and the previous word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that Markov chains are stochastic, and determine their next state
          solely from the previous state, I determined that it was not the best
          model for speech - sentences must encode grammar and subject matter
          in longer phrases and not single words. However, the results were comical, and it was
          a very educational project!
        </p>
        <p>
          This project won a <b>gold medal</b> at the Long Island Math Fair!
